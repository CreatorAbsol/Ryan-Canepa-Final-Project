<!--The background uses a blurred version of my logo with the CSS that runs in the back, as well as the logo that sits in the top left being where that would be seen for an official webpage. For most of this project, there was a large amount of experimentation, but all in all, that ended up turning into something just a bit more simple than expected.-->
