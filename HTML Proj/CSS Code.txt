The body code currently controls the background and text for the most part. 

body{
    background-color: rgb(155, 200, 227);
    background-image: url(file:///E:/HTML%20Proj/Blurred%20Logo.png);
    color: black;
    margin:0;
}

The h1 code here is determining the font style for this section.

h1{
    font-style: bold;
    font-size: 500;
}

The h2 code in this CSS page is for another piece of code for the HTML that was implemented before, but is not needed for now. Eventually, there will be a bit more

h2{
    position: absolute;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
